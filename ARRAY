Arrays do NOT know their size
Bounds are NOT checked
Indexing is just pointer arithmetic

================================1st issue==================
What really happened?
You didn’t just get an “array error”.
You read memory you do not own.
C didn’t stop you.
The compiler didn’t stop you.
The OS didn’t stop you.
